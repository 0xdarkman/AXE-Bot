#### Important !

> After installing in Docker and first launch you MUST edit config.json and put there "bot_id", then [rebuild an image ](#Update), because Docker doesn't save "bot_id" in config file while first run and will generate a new one for each run.

> Example code that you must put to the end of config.json:
"bot_id": "YOUR BOT_ID"

> Note: after the previous line before "bot_id": "YOUR BOT_ID" you must put ",". After "bot_id": "YOUR BOT_ID" don't need put ",". Also, you need to mount "data" folder to your image, for saving results to SQLite or using Firebase.

##### Creating own strategy

> Before do it, please, read the [Docs](#config) and [FAQ](FAQ.md)

##### Example strategy

> BUY on signal, RSI<=35 or/and price>=BB_LOW (timeframe 15m), then start trailing SELL, or wait SELL signal and start trail sell after

> SELL on signal, RSI>=77 or/and price>=BB_UP (timeframe 15m), with minimal or more guaranteed (0.7%) `price_buffer_for_start_sell_on_sell_signal` profit, if price goes up, of course ;)

> While using SELL on sell signal you may insurance risk and set stop loss `use_stop_loss_while_start_sell_on_sell_signal`,  `stop_loss_percent_for_start_sell_on_sell_signal` - WATCH OUT!

> If you don't using SELL signal - stop loss will be equal (sell_trail_step), and will be changed after with `dynamic_trail_enable` help
